WRITTEN REVIEW:
Mee Heng Low is a noodle house with a vague resemblance to Chinese noodles. Mee Heng Low offers four primary options of noodles and several meat options. Of the noodle options there is chow mein, low mein, soup, and some other option. The meat options included chicken, beef, shrimp, and some others. The food was decent. The noodles were done well, though not served hot. The vegetables were a nice consistency, not cooked too long but cooked enough that they clearly were not raw. The saving grace of the meal overall was the subtle yet sweet taste of the sweet plum sauce. However, this was not nearly what I expected (I expected a sauce more similar to Hoisin plum sauce) and so while I accepted that the food was not bad, it was still something of a disappointment.
The service at Mee Heng Low was standard. Once my order was placed and the food was finished cooking, it was brought to me at my table. However, my water was refilled in a relatively timely manner. I think our server went a step above when he explained why a customer that had ordered his food after me received his food before me. I feel like it could go either way, the server could have easily carried on without mentioning to me why my food was slower in getting to my table. I appreciate that he explained it and I think that deserved a bump in Mee Heng Low's otherwise average score.
Mee Heng Low had a very casual, cozy atmosphere to it. It felt like an urban building -- some pipes exposed and the walls made of brick. I liked the ambience that the decorations had to offer, and I very much enjoy the atmosphere that Mee Heng Low has managed to establish in their building.
Overall, I think Mee Heng Low was a relatively average experience, with bonus points for the atmosphere and quality of our server. I would not go to Mee Heng Low very often, but it is certainly a place that I wouldn't mind going to every now and then, possibly even suggest going to.

WRITTEN REVIEW:
Upper Crust Trattoria is an italian restaurant in San Luis Obispo. The food has several very good qualities: very good taste (especially the soup), abundant bread (unlimited actually), and good proportions. Although I may have ate more bread than the average bear, I think that the size of the proportions leave you satisfied and if necessary the bread is unlimited. Additionally, the bread goes marvelously well both with the pasta sauce and the soup broth. The soup broth had a very noticeable taste but not particularly overwhelming. The only problem I had with the food was that the pasta itself was not particularly flavored, but the meat (I had chicken marsala) tasted so absolutely wonderful it more than made up for the lack of succulence in the pasta.
The service at Upper Crust was also very good. If my waiter was walking by the table, we were sure to be asked how our food tasted and if we had any needs. The servers were also nice, appropriately talkative, and quick to smile.
Upper Crust had a definite atmosphere of elegance established. Much of the furniture was made of some sort of wood, or made to look like wood, and the lighting was dim and warm. We had been placed in front of a fireplace (though not lit) that even gave the restaurant a sort of cozy at home feel. Additionally there was an awesome drunk guy that tried his hand at chatting with some ladies that was particularly amusing.
Overall, Upper Crust far exceeded my expectations. From the outside appearance and the name I wasn't sure if the place was just a fancy pizza place beyond the likes of California Pizza Kitchen. To my surprise, Upper Crust was a very great tasting italian restaurant with quite a bit of style and personality. I would highly recommend Upper Crust to anyone and everyone (though it's expensive).

WRITTEN REVIEW:
Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is a BBQ restaurant that primarily serves burgers, BBQ ribs, BBQ chicken, and various sandwiches. The selection was not terribly diverse, but they had 'Killer Garlic Fries' which were sure to be a great hit. Sure enough, their BBQ tastes quite good and their garlic fries lived up to my expectations of garlic-ness. Although, thinking back on it, it wasn't particularly memorable, so despite it being good and me quite enjoying it, I wonder if it wasn't exceptional, hence the 4.
Service at Moe's smokehouse was wonderful, at least as far as BBQ grill restaurants go. It didn't necessarily have the typical male server or register worker that really gives BBQ or bar and grill restaurants a feel of ruggedness. However, the servers were quick to bring us our food, and despite not expecting any service they even asked if we needed anything a couple times. I think as far as BBQ restaurants goes Moe's, at least today, had quite good service.
Moe's atmosphere was quite typical: A walk up register where you order, a soda fountain, and a look and feel very similar to most BBQ restaurants I've been to. Although, that being said, I also didn't pay much attention to any of their pictures and artwork. I may have missed out on the appeal of the restaurant itself but I didn't think there is anything I would consider memorable decorating their walls.
Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is exactly what you would expect, plus bonus taste and service. I think it is definitely a good place to go every once in awhile. Of course, being a BBQ restaurant it shouldn't be frequented too often, but the price is affordable for a fair amount of food (including a lot of fries) and the overall experience is quite comforting.
